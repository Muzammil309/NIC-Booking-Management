## 🔍 Why You Can't Login - Diagnosis

Since the database record is correct, the login issue is likely one of these:

### Issue 1: Email Not Confirmed ⚠️ (MOST LIKELY)
**Symptom**: Login fails with error like "Email not confirmed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Cause**: Supabase requires email confirmation by default. When the account was created with the broken code, the confirmation email might not have been sent or clicked.

**How to Check**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find jawad@nic.com
3. Look for "Email Confirmed" status
4. If it says "Not confirmed" or shows a warning icon, this is the issue

**Solution**: See "Fix 1" below

---

### Issue 2: Wrong Password 🔑
**Symptom**: Login fails with "Invalid credentials"

**Cause**: You might be using the wrong password, or the password wasn't set correctly during creation

**Solution**: See "Fix 2" below

---

### Issue 3: Browser Cache/Cookies 🍪
**Symptom**: Login seems to work but redirects back to login page

**Cause**: Old session data or cached credentials

**Solution**: See "Fix 3" below

---

### Issue 4: RLS Policies Blocking Access 🔒
**Status**: ✅ **NOT THE ISSUE**

I checked the RLS policies on the users table:
- `users_select_own`: Allows users to read their own record
- `users_insert_own`: Allows authenticated users to insert
- `users_update_own`: Allows users to update their own record

These policies are correct and won't block login.

## 🔧 Solutions

### Fix 1: Confirm Email (RECOMMENDED - Try This First)

#### Option A: Manual Confirmation via Supabase Dashboard
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Project: nic-booking-management

2. **Navigate to Authentication**
   - Click: Authentication → Users

3. **Find the User**
   - Look for: jawad@nic.com
   - Click on the user to view details

4. **Check Email Confirmation Status**
   - Look for: "Email Confirmed" field
   - If it says "Not confirmed" or shows a warning:

5. **Manually Confirm Email**
   - Click the **three dots (...)** menu
   - Select: **Confirm email** or **Send confirmation email**
   - OR click the **Edit user** button
   - Toggle: **Email confirmed** to ON
   - Save changes

6. **Test Login**
   - Go to NIC Booking app
   - Try logging in with jawad@nic.com
   - Should work now!

#### Option B: SQL Confirmation (Advanced)
Unfortunately, we can't directly update auth.users via SQL for security reasons. Use Option A instead.

---

### Fix 2: Reset Password

If email is confirmed but login still fails, reset the password:

#### Via Supabase Dashboard
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Authentication → Users → jawad@nic.com

2. **Reset Password**
   - Click: **three dots (...)** → **Send password reset email**
   - OR click: **Edit user** → Set new password manually

3. **Set New Password Manually** (Easier)
   - Click: **Edit user**
   - Find: **Password** field
   - Enter a new password (min 6 characters)
   - Click: **Save**

4. **Test Login**
   - Use the new password to login

---

### Fix 3: Clear Browser Cache

1. **Hard Refresh**
   - Press: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

2. **Clear Cookies**
   - Press F12 → Application tab → Cookies
   - Delete all cookies for your NIC Booking app domain

3. **Try Incognito/Private Window**
   - Open incognito/private browsing
   - Try logging in there

4. **Clear All Cache**
   - Browser Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Select: Cookies and Cached images/files
   - Clear data

---

### Fix 4: Verify Auth User Exists

Let's make sure the auth.users record exists:

1. **Check in Supabase Dashboard**
   - Authentication → Users
   - Search for: jawad@nic.com
   - Should see the user in the list

2. **If User Doesn't Exist in Auth**
   - This means the auth user was deleted but database record remains
   - **Solution**: Delete the database record and recreate the account:

```sql
-- Delete the database record
DELETE FROM public.users WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com';

-- Then use "Create Admin Account" button to recreate
```
