## 🔧 Additional Actions You Can Take

### 1. Add Phone Number
If you want to add a phone number to your profile:

2. Go to Startups tab
3. Find "Jawad Ahmad" in the users table
4. Click "Edit" button
5. Add phone number (e.g., +92-300-1234567)

UPDATE public.users 
SET phone = '+92-300-1234567' 
WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com';
```

### 2. Change Password Later
If you want to change the password from `jawad123` to something else:

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Fails

#### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or try in incognito/private window

#### 2. Check Browser Console
- Press F12 → Console tab
- Try to login
- Look for error messages
- Common errors:
  - "Invalid credentials" → Double-check password is `jawad123`
  - "Network error" → Check internet connection
  - "CORS error" → Check Supabase project settings

#### 3. Verify Email Confirmation
Run this SQL to check:
```sql
SELECT email, email_confirmed_at 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com';
```
Should show a timestamp for `email_confirmed_at`

#### 4. Test Password
The password is definitely set to `jawad123` (case-sensitive)
- Make sure you're typing it exactly: `jawad123`
- No spaces before or after
- All lowercase

#### 5. Check Account Status
Run this SQL:
```sql
SELECT 
    email, 
    email_confirmed_at, 
    banned_until, 
    deleted_at 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com';
```
- `email_confirmed_at` should have a timestamp
- `banned_until` should be NULL
- `deleted_at` should be NULL
