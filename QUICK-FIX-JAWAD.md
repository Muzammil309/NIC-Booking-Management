# Quick Fix: jawad@nic.com Account

## 🎯 Problem
- ❌ Can't login with jawad@nic.com
- ❌ Doesn't appear in Contact Us tab
- ⚠️ Error: "Email already registered in authentication system"

## ✅ Solution (Choose One)

---

### Option A: SQL Insert (FASTEST - 3 minutes) ⭐

#### 1. Get UUID
- Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- Click on `jawad@nic.com`
- Copy the **User UID** (looks like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

#### 2. Run SQL
- Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query
- Paste this (replace `YOUR_UUID_HERE` with the UUID from step 1):

```sql
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name, role, phone, created_at)
VALUES (
    'YOUR_UUID_HERE',  -- Replace with actual UUID
    'jawad@nic.com',
    'Jawad Ahmad',
    'admin',
    NULL,
    NOW()
);
```

#### 3. Verify
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com';
```

#### 4. Test
- Go to Contact Us tab → Should see Jawad Ahmad
- Login as jawad@nic.com → Should work!

### Option B: Delete & Recreate (EASIEST - 2 minutes)

#### 1. Delete Auth User

  - Email: `jawad@nic.com`
  - Password: (new password)

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After fixing:
- [ ] User exists in database: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'jawad@nic.com'`
- [ ] Appears in Contact Us tab
- [ ] Can login with credentials
- [ ] Has admin role and privileges

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"duplicate key" error**
→ User already exists, try logging in

**"foreign key violation"**
→ Wrong UUID, double-check from Dashboard

**Can't find user in Authentication**
→ Use Option B (Delete & Recreate)

**Login still fails**
→ Clear browser cache, try incognito

## 📝 My Recommendation

**Use Option A (SQL Insert)** if:
- ✅ You want to keep the existing password
- ✅ You're comfortable with SQL

**Use Option B (Delete & Recreate)** if:
- ✅ You want the simplest solution
- ✅ You don't mind setting a new password

Both work perfectly - choose what you're comfortable with!
