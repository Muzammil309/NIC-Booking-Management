# Quick Fix Guide: jawad@nic.com Account

## Problem
You created an admin account with email `jawad@nic.com` but:
- ‚ùå It doesn't appear in Contact Us tab
- ‚ùå You can't login with the credentials

## Why This Happened
The old code only created the authentication user but didn't create the database record. The code is now fixed, but your existing account needs to be repaired.

### Option 2: Manual Database Insert (ADVANCED)

#### Step 1: Get the Auth User ID
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
3. Find `jawad@nic.com`
4. Click on the user to view details
5. Copy the **User UID** (looks like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

#### Step 2: Insert User Record
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New query**
3. Paste this SQL (replace `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with the actual UUID):

```sql
-- Insert user record for jawad@nic.com
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name, role, phone)
VALUES (
    'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE',  -- Replace with actual UUID from Step 1
    'jawad@nic.com',
    'Jawad Ahmad',        -- Change if needed
    'admin',
    '+92-300-1234567'     -- Change or set to NULL if no phone

## Recommended Approach

**I recommend Option 1 (Delete and Recreate)** because:
- ‚úÖ Simplest and fastest
- ‚úÖ No risk of UUID mismatch
- ‚úÖ Uses the fixed code
- ‚úÖ Ensures everything is set up correctly
- ‚úÖ Takes less than 2 minutes

The only downside is you need to set a new password, but since the account wasn't working anyway, this doesn't matter.

## After Fixing

Once you've fixed the account using any of the options above, you should be able to:

### 1. See Admin in Contact Us Tab
- Go to **Contact Us** tab
- You should see:
  ```
  NIC Admin Contacts

  admin@nic.com
  [Email button]

  Jawad Ahmad
  jawad@nic.com
  +92-300-1234567 (if you added phone)
  [Email button]
  ```

### 2. Login as Jawad
- Logout from current session
- Click **Login**
- Enter:
  - Email: `jawad@nic.com`
  - Password: (the password you set)
