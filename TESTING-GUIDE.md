## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "User already registered" error
**Solution**: The new code now checks for existing users and offers to convert them to admin if they're startup users.

### Issue: Can't see admin contacts as startup user
**Solution**: This should already work. Verify you're on the Contact Us tab and logged in as a startup user.

### Issue: Fullscreen lock not working
**Possible causes**:
1. Browser doesn't support Fullscreen API (very rare)
2. User is logged in as admin (admins get simple confirmation, not password lock)
3. JavaScript error - check browser console

**Solution**: 
- Test in different browser
- Verify user is NOT logged in as admin
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Can't exit fullscreen even with correct password
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're entering the password for the admin@nic.com account
- Check that the admin account exists and password is correct
- Try refreshing the page and re-entering fullscreen

---

## Security Notes

### Admin Password
- The fullscreen lock uses the password for `admin@nic.com` by default
- Make sure this account exists and the password is known to authorized personnel
- Document the password securely for staff who need to manage displays

### Customizing Admin Email
If you want to use a different admin email for password verification, update this line in the code:

```javascript
// In verifyAdminPasswordForExit() function
const { error } = await supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email: 'admin@nic.com', // Change this to your preferred admin email
    password: password
});
```
